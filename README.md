# mars_weather-challenge
## In this challenge i was required to:
## Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news siteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
- Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
- Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows: Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. Store all the dictionaries in a Python list. Print the list in your notebook.

## Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data SiteLinks to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape. Note that the URL is https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.
- Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. Note that this can also be achieved by using the Pandas read_html function. However, use Beautiful Soup here to continue sharpening your web scraping skills.
- Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings: id, terrestrial_date, sol, ls, month. min_temp, and pressure. 
- Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
- Analyze your dataset by using Pandas

## Challenges
- Some of my plots were givingme isues but I think everything went well for the most part. The minimum and maximum temperatures were also confusing for a couple of minutes becuase they are all negative numbers.
